# AUTOMATIC WATERING
## ABSTRACT
Plants, as we all know, are an integral component of our lives. Plants require constant attention in order to thrive. Plants may not be able to survive if the soil and surroundings are deficient in nutrients. As a result of this effort, we will be able to make our gardens self-sustaining. The sensor we used in this project checks the soil moisture and air temperature of the plants, and then starts watering them automatically based on the data obtained from the numerous sensors in our project. It is critical to maintain and monitor our plants and gardens. We must care the plants on a regular basis in order to keep them free of pests. As a result, this endeavour aids the garden's self-care.
## DESCRIPATION
Plants play a vital role in maintaining the carbon dioxide and oxygen in air. Many plants die due to urbanization. But apart from it plants also die due to lack of maintenance. Gardening is a healthiest hobby anyone can adopt. But they need continuous care without break. So the main aim of this project is to provide proper care to the plants. This project will also ease the gardening. It is built using AVR Microcontroller and bunch of electronic sensors.. In this project we have used soil moisture sensor for calculating the moisture in the soil .The controller is interfaced with the LCD display where it displays the data received from various sensors. The controller is programmed using embedded C.
